Curated from the Floating Bridge Press Evergreen Award Tour submissions, the 2019 AAF Poetry Award was given to a single poem of exceptional merit. The guest judge, award-winning poet Keetje Kuipers, chose “Poem for Trending Tragedy” by Kathryn Smith.

Kuipers had this to say:  “In a world driven to distraction, it can be a challenge for anything that matters—much less a poem that attempts to discern the value of information—to break through the noise. *Poem for Trending Tragedy* not only illustrates this struggle, it also overcomes it. The poem maintains a conversational tone, welcoming us into a world that includes tragedies both major and minor, from kidnapping to a ‘lip-sync fiasco.’ Yet even the trivial is carefully guarded from flippancy—as the poem states, ‘I know what I know / changes nothing.’ And yet, this speaker counsels us to listen more closely, think more intentionally. We’re asked to know the world for everything it is, and I’m glad for this powerful voice urging us to pay attention on the page and off.”

**Kathryn Smith** is a poet and collage artist in Spokane, WA. She is the author of the poetry collection  Book of Exodus  (Scablands Books, 2017) and the forthcoming chapbook  Chosen Companions of the Goblin , winner of the 2018 Open Country Press Chapbook Contest. Her poems have been published in *Poetry Northwest*, *Mid-American Review*, *Bellingham Review*, *Redivider*, *The Journal*, and elsewhere, and have earned a Spokane Arts Grant Award and a Pushcart special mention. Her website is [www.kathrynsmithpoetry.com](www.kathrynsmithpoetry.com), and she posts collage work on Instagram: @paperhermitage.
