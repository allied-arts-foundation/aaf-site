SCRiB LAB offers space for writers to experiment, together-but-alone, with programs for writers of all genres and ages.

Miriam Tobin created SCRiB LAB as a way for writers and artists to connect without having to leave their homes. This is a community where writers can write, read, brainstorm, explore, and question the world together.
