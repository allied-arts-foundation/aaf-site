Paul Kikuchi is a musician, activist, and educator whose work is informed by highly diverse influences — from his roots as a rock drummer to his experience as a Feldenkrais practitioner — as well as his research into Japanese-American history in the Pacific Northwest.

His interdisciplinary work seeks to generate reflection and dialogue, especially in the context of history, community, and identity. Paul is a music faculty member at South Seattle College, and serves as board vice president at the Japanese Cultural and Community Center of WA.
