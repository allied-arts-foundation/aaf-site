The Simorgh Dance Collective is a worldwide collaborative dance ensemble that seeks to interpret, present, and perform traditional classical, folkloric, and sacred dances of the Silk Road.

Farima Berenji established the Simorgh Dance Collective in 2007. Based on her training and experience, she began a worldwide collaboration with other traditional dancers and musicians for it to become a world community of expert and emerging artists devoted to traditional performing arts of the Silk Road. The Simorgh Dance Collective is honored to be the first Persian dance company directed by an Iranian-American woman (Farima Berenji) to perform during a U.S. presidential reception for President Barak Obama.

Our member groups worldwide learn and develop an appreciation of Silk Road art and cultures by engaging with expert and emerging artists devoted to its dance and music. We share this art and love with our local communities by presenting ethnic dances in traditional costume, educating in cultural lectures, and leading dance participations. Our members show dedication as a team to develop and share their talents in these presentations.
Today, itâ€™s increasingly important to share an appreciation of the art of Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other regions of the historic Silk Road. Our work helps present and build an awareness of traditional Persian and Silk Road dance and culture in a world today that ever threatens its existence in its land of origin. It enriches the lives of those who trace their ancestry to these cultures while bringing beauty to our communities.
