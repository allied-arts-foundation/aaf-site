Seattle World Tour Foundation‘s mission is to build a more equitable and healthy community by helping to provide funding and programing to underserved communities. They unite artists, businesses and community members through unique events, programs and concerts.

Their 2021 “Music With A Message Series” is a 3-month digital and physical campaign focused on giving back to the Rainier Valley Food Bank and South King County / Eastside COVID Mutual AID, while providing a platform to local musicians simultaneously through a 12 week, 12 artist video highlight series.
