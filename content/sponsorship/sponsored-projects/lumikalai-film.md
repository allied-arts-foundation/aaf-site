Eli Ives of Lumikalai Film is producing Colour Creates Light: A Diaspora in Four Films, an international series of feature-length documentary films related to the atelier of painter Hans Hofmann (1880-1966). The teaching at the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts, permutated through the lives of three alumnae, offers a conduit into the heart of the visual creative process.
