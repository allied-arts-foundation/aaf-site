Words of a King is an initiative to bring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s words to younger generations through hip hop, related visuals, and curricula.

Co-written by Katherine Lynn Nemeth and Cameron Lavi-Jones, the song, “Words of a King,” is based as closely as possible on quotes from Dr. Martin Luther King’s speeches using rap and gospel style with a hip hop beat. The final version of the song and visuals will be broadcast quality for worldwide distribution.
“Words of a King” is performed by 21-year-old activist, producer, and artist Cameron Lavi-Jones.

Katherine Lynn Nemeth is an artist, educator, and visionary, who is passionately intent to reach every school-age young person in America. “My goal is for every child, whether BIPOC or Caucasian, to feel the elevation and enlightenment through this song and visuals to effect the powerful social change we need now and in the future.”
