Created by filmmaker Trudy James at her Heartwork Productions, Speaking of Dying captures the importance of individuals and groups speaking openly about all aspects of the dying process.
“Viewing this film will inspire and encourage you to talk to your friends, family, health care agents and medical providers about your own end of life planning, choices and wishes.”
