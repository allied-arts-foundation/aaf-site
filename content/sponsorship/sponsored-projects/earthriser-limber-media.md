EARTHRISER is a climate change film composed of two parts: “Love Song For A Wailing Earth” and “Dance Of A Future Climate Refugee.” The film features Seattle-based dancer Allegra Searle-LeBel, renowned mediamaker Cole Rise, and an award-winning Pacific Northwest production team.

The first part, “Love Song For A Wailing Earth,” is about one woman’s climate grief, expressed through her dance in a Washington old-growth forest. This project is currently in production, to be released worldwide on the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day (April 22, 2020).
