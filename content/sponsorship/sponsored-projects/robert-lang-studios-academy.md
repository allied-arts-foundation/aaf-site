Robert Lang Studios Academy offers programs structured for students to understand and respect the recording studio environment, as well as develop an understanding of how to best use the spaces and tools available to make their career in the studio industry.

From the early Northwest sound of the Sonics and 15 year old Kenny G, to Nirvana’s final studio recording, to today’s finest musicians like Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, Robert Lang Studios continues to expand, create and inspire!
