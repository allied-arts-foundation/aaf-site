Stage Struck teaches young performers self-confidence, cooperation among peers and appreciation for history through the arts. They put together their own unique revues offering all participants a chance to act, dance, and sing. Stage Struck teachers offer students a rigorous, challenging experience in the craft of rehearsal and performance.
