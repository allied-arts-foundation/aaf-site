Degenerate Art Ensemble makes live performances inspired by punk, comics, cinema, nightmares and fairy tales driven by live music and their own style of visceral movement theater and dance. Their work is an exorcism through collision and conflict challenging how we see audience, architecture, music, story, myth and reality. It comes out of a deep desire for communion and soul-exchange and transformation.

Degenerate Art Ensemble will be participating in the International Festival of Contemporary Dance Mexico City on August 11, 2021 with a performance of Skeleton Flower.
This engagement is supported by Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation through USArtists International in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
