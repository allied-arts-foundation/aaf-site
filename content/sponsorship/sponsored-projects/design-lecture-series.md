The Design Lecture Series, produced by Civilization, brings world-class designers to the stage to share their knowledge for free. Its aim is to stimulate conversation around design, share its rich history and inspire our communities. Posters from the series have won multiple print awards and are included in SFMOMAâ€™s permanent collection.
