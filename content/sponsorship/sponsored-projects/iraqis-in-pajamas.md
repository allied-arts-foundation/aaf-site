Founded by Loolwa Khazzoom, the band Iraqis in Pajamas fuses ancient Iraqi Jewish prayers with original punk rock and personal storytelling, singing in Judeo-Arabic, Hebrew, and English. In turn vulnerable and angry, haunting and inspiring, the band disarms audiences, opening listeners to deep contemplation about trauma, healing, and transformation. The band is fundraising to produce and promote a full-length double album, Punk iRock: The first CD will be the original version of the 10 Iraqi Jewish prayers, and the second CD will be these prayers sung in all their punk rock glory.
