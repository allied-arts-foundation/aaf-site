Founded by Lee Mozena of Zena Consulting in Redmond, WA, the Malikah Festival brings the elegance and nuance of modest fashion out of mosques and private homes, and into a public venue. It also shatters simplistic stereotypes about families who practice modesty as a form of dress and lifestyle choice, using arts and culture as a vehicle to bring citizens together.
