South Sound Baroque Orchestra is a group of local musicians that began meeting in September of 2015 with the intent of performing concerts in and around the Seattle area. Because of their instrumentation, their musical selections will generally come from the baroque period and will include composers such as Bach, Handel, Haydn, Vivaldi and others.
