The mission of SOLA (“Support of Old Lady Artists”) is to award cash grants to female visual artists over 60 who are currently working and living in Washington State and have created a body of work spanning at least 25 years.

The SOLA Award honors accomplished yet under-recognized women artists for their dedication and persistence.
