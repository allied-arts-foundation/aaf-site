Founded by famed football running back Robert Turbin, Runnin4U allows Robert to continue his passion for community service, help fund the research and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis and Cerebral Palsy, and to supply the Irvington High athletic teams with safety and field equipment, uniforms, first-aid, coaching and training assistance. Runnin4U will be partnering with a Seattle music station to promote local musicians.
