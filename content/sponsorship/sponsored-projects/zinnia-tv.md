Zinnia TV provides online content channels with artful videos to help people with dementia feel engaged and connected.

Even the most dedicated care partners rely on TV at times to occupy the person living with dementia. But standard programming created for healthy brains can trigger distress for a person who is no longer able to track a plot, tell fiction from reality, or track rapidly moving images and sounds. Zinniaâ€™s content channels feature familiar faces, subjects, and sounds.
