Embrace Diversity in America Art Project is being produced by Janice Maria Alexander, artist, author, and president of Artistic Angels Corporation. The project’s mission is to contribute to the goal of reducing hate crimes in America and helping to unify our nation by bringing an artistic awareness to the beauty and blessings of multiculturalism.

The culmination of this project will be a body of artwork consisting of twelve oil paintings to be exhibited through the Los Angeles Art Association and other venues, and a video production showcasing and describing the artwork with a speech about the importance of embracing diversity in America by Janice Marie Alexander. All donors will be given credit for their contributions in the exhibits and the video.

This project will be created in Los Angeles, California with the help of an assistant, Brian Gerald Vaughn. Janice will create each of the twelve oil paintings depicting different races and cultures in America with the goal of presenting a beautiful body of artwork promoting diversity in America. Brian will build and maintain the project and Janice’s website, social media sites, set up exhibits and produce the project’s video. Janice has a master’s degree and 25 years of business experience in art, sales and marketing. The creation of the project will begin June 2021 and end May 2023.
