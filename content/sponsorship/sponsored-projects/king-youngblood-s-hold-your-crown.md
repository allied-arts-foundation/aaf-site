Hold Your Crown is an ongoing project founded by rising Seattle alt-rock band, King Youngblood (formerly Gypsy Temple), that focuses on breaking the stigma that many young people from middle school through college-age and young adults face when they live with a mental illness.

Most members of King Youngblood are between 20 â€“ 23 years old. Hold Your Crown aims to spread a message of hope and solidarity through their music as well as peer-to-peer speaking engagements in schools, video messages shared through social media, press releases focused on their core message, written materials and merchandise embracing the Hold Your Crown message. 

Hold Your Crown is collaborating with the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), the Stability Network, the King County Mental Health Court and other national and regional non- profit organizations and government offices.
