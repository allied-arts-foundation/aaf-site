Nrityalaya School of Dance was founded by Vidyalakshmi Vinod in 2002 in the greater Seattle area to teach students the ancient Indian classical dance, Bharatanatyam.

The school strives to impart quality dance education and disciplined training to its students and help them grow into professional classical dancers.
