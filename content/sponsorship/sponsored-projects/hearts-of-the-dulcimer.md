Artists Patricia Delich and Wayne Jiang are now seeking funding to create a docuseries which will provide the general public with an entertaining and in-depth introduction to the dulcimer, while affirming its cultural position to dulcimer enthusiasts.

The docuseries will combine footage from live performances, archival material, travelogues, on-location interviews, narrative animation, and motion graphics.
