The Firehouse Arts and Events Center is a local, regional and national venue for the performing arts, and is dedicated to connecting the community with the arts.   

Located in a Bellingham, WA, renovated historic 1927 Fire Station, the Firehouse offers space for classes, workshops and performances. The Firehouse is home to many fine local artists and strives to be a quality affordable venue for the smaller performing arts groups so they have a space to teach, learn, and perform, allowing them opportunities they cannot otherwise afford.
