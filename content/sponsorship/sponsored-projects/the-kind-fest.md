The Kind Fest is a grassroots festival that was inspired by the desire to shine a light on one of the easiest and most effective tools for creating community, joy, and connection: Kindness.

Their mission is to create a kinder world by modeling, educating, and encouraging others to action and honoring how it is already in practice. Their goal is to cultivate personal and community impact and create connection through one big celebration of kindness.
