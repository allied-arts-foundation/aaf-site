Museum Without Walls’ objective is to inspire the next generation to become social justice leaders who will ignite change in their communities.  We do this by providing the unique opportunity to hear first hand accounts of intolerance and racism at the site where it was experienced.

Museum Without Walls’ vision is to educate and inspire middle-high school students to become informed, engaged and motivated leaders who are emboldened to promote social justice in our communities.
