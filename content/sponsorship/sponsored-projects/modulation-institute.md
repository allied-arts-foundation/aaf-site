Modulation Institute is a safe space for Trans & Non-Binary individuals to receive 1:1 private vocal training from any location. Modulation Voice is designed for us to work together as a team on vocal feminization, vocal masculinization, and non-binary vocal expression in speech or singing.

Intentions of identity are vast, but our voice is arguably one of the most important characteristics. Identity-affirming voice coaching and music tutoring are valuable in further understanding our identity. Modulate & Create offers a space for vocal support and expression through many different avenues such as Storytelling, Songwriting, Audio Engineering, and multiple instrumental options. 

How do you express yourself vocally? Do you have a desire to add more musicality to your vocal expression? If youâ€™ve ever had an interest in songwriting, recording, or playing an instrument, Modulation Institute has the services for you!
