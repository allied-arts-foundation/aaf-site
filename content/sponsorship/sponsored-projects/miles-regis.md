LA-based, Trinidad-born artist Miles Regis is prolific in both fine art and fashion design. Regis freely swaps the materials and languages of each to enrich the other. His large-scale mixed media paintings on canvas and linen incorporate dimensional collage elements of denim, buttons, leather, printed matter, sequins, and patches of eclectically sourced found textiles along with his dextrous, gestural, richly hued abstract and figurative painting techniques. Aggressively hopeful and humanistic, Regis embraces a storytelling stance in his stylized renditions of fundamental scenes of love, loss, freedom, survival, activism, and living history.

Donations to Miles support costs of supplies, production, travel, marketing and other associated expenses of making his work. Visit his website to purchase his artwork, clothing, and more.
