Sinners, a play by veteran Israeli dramatist Joshua Sobol, is a theatrical protest against heinous fact: the stoning of women to death in Iran and other Middle Eastern countries. The playâ€™s setting is stark and startling: Layla, a married professor of English, is buried over her waist in the desert sand. She is about to be stoned because of accusations she had an adulterous affair with one of her married students, who, out of guilt, talked about the tryst to the authorities.

This project is working to bring this powerful and important theatrical work to new audiences.
